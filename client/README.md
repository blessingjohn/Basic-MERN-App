# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to view it. The page will reload when changes are made, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. The app is optimized for the best performance, with minified files and hashed filenames.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once ejected, you cannot revert. Use this if you need complete control over configuration but proceed cautiously.
